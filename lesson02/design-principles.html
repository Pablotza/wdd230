                <h3>Google</h3>

                <p>The more information and stimuli a page provides, the longer it takes to decide what to do. The cognitive load makes it difficult to make a clear and quick decision. 
                    Google's simplified design allows users to focus on their main task - searching - without being overwhelmed by too many options or distractions. In this way, Google increases efficiency and improves the user experience, perfectly in line with the essence of Hick's Law.</p>

                <img src="./images/github.jpeg" alt="GitHub">
                <p>GitHub's interface is a great example of this. The consistent use of colors, typography, and button styles throughout the platform creates a cohesive and recognizable brand identity. This repetition in design elements makes the interface more intuitive and easier for users to navigate, as repeated patterns help users quickly learn and understand the layout and functionalities of the site.</p>

                <img src="./images/Netflix.png" alt="Netflix">
                <p>Netflix uses contrast effectively in its interface design. For example, it uses a dark background with bright colors for movie and TV show thumbnails, making them stand out and catch the viewer's eye. This helps in guiding users' attention to new or recommended content. Furthermore, the use of contrasting colors improves the visibility and legibility of text and controls, making the user experience more engaging and straightforward.</p>
